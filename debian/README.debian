This kexec-tools package was built from kexec-tools git repository at 
<git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/kexec-tools.git>. 

Installing this package also installs two init scripts under /etc/init.d - 
kexec-load and kexec. kexec-load is called upon reboot to load a new kexec
kernel if kexec is enabled in /etc/default/kexec. kexec script is called 
just before reboot script. It checks if kexec is enabled and a
kexec'able kernel is loaded. If yes, it kexecs a new kernel instead of
reboot. As a result, kexec is automatically enabled upon installation of 
kexec-tools package if kexec is enabled in /etc/default/kexec through debconf
option.
